What Emergence Means Here

• Emergence is not creation.

• Emergence is not intention.

• Emergence is not usefulness.

Emergence is the moment something becomes noticeable without becoming necessary.

Within this field:

• A generator output is not an artifact

• A noticeable form is not a candidate

• A candidate is not a promise

Emergence is a state, not an event.

Nothing that emerges is assumed to:

• want a market

• want an audience

• want continuity

• want interpretation

Emergence is allowed to dissolve without trace.
