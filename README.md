# hcm-emergence-bridge

This repository defines the Emergence Bridge within the HCM field.

The Emergence Bridge is the structural boundary between:

• generation

• and existence

Anything that passes through this bridge is not yet an artifact.

The bridge:

• does not decide

• does not validate

• does not reject

• does not optimize

• does not prepare for release

It only allows presence without consequence.

If nothing crosses the bridge, nothing is missing.
If many things cross the bridge, nothing is owed.
