Failure Conditions

This repository is considered compromised if:

• generator outputs are treated as artifacts

• accumulation creates pressure

• silence is interpreted as blockage

• emergence is confused with intent

• the bridge becomes a decision surface

In case of failure:

• do nothing

• do not compensate

• do not “fix”

allow silence to reset the field
