Observation Without Selection

Observation in this layer is passive and archival only.

Allowed:

• noting existence

• timestamping presence

• recording origin (generator / source)

•silent disappearance

Forbidden:

• ranking

• tagging for release

• tagging for monetization

• clustering by theme or potential

The bridge does not distinguish between:

• trivial

• profound

• useful

• unusable

All distinctions belong elsewhere—or nowhere.
