Principles of Non-Commitment

The Emergence Bridge enforces the following invariants:

1. No output implies continuation

2. No frequency implies rhythm

3. No pattern implies strategy

4. No observation implies action

5. No accumulation implies value

The bridge explicitly forbids:

• queues

• backlogs

• pipelines

• optimization metrics

• readiness scoring

Anything that requires “next steps” does not belong here.
